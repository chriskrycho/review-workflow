# Peer Review workflows

How we do reviews in Guest Experience:

1. Create a branch.
2. Push it to GitHub.
3. Create a pull-request as soon as you like.
4. Do whatever you want with it. Squash and rebase to your heart's content. 
5. Get reviewed.
6. Add more commits. Squash and rebase *those* as much as you like, but don't
   update the commits that occurred prior to the review.

This is a change that might be "atomic" as far as the tracking issue in JIRA is
concerned – I'm just updating the README file, after all! – but since it is
being created *after* a review, I won't amend the previous commit.
