# Peer Review workflows

How we do reviews in Guest Experience:

1. Create a branch.
2. Push it to GitHub.
3. Create a pull-request as soon as you like.
4. Do whatever you want with it. Squash and rebase to your heart's content. 
5. Get reviewed.
6. Just keep squashing and rebasing.

(You can imagine that this initial state was created in a way that involved an
amend commit... because *it actually did.*)
